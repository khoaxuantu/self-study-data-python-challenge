# Python Challenge Project 5 - Web Scraping + Regular Expression

This folder contains all participants' codes and the reviews associated with each file. Beside giving out bonus points to the finished works, we also review the codes based on their readability and their correctness.

Each file is named as your Discord username, so please choose your correct file and see if your code is qualified enough.

> P/S: Don't take the bad grammar seriously ðŸ˜ƒ We made the reviews quickly, so we did not correct them carefully.
